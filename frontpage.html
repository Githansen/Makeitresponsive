		<strong> What is frugal innovation? </strong>  <br> <br>
		Frugal Innovation is a procces where products are made less complex,
		in order to reduce cost and increase durability.
At Inova we believe this is an important step towards ensuring responsible and sustainable
 consumption of the earth's resources. 
Throuhg innovation camps we hope to spread knowledge and interest in Frugal Innovation,
 with the goal being that it becomes a natural and obvious part of any innovation cycle.
 Scroll down to see some examples of frugal innovation.

		<strong> Innovation Camps </strong> <br> <br>
		At innovation camps you will be guided and challenged by our wonderfull teacher. 
		You will work with cases, both in the abstract and the concrete, and you will learn 
		to broaden your approach to innovation techniques.

				 <p class = "photo">Standord Univserity developed a paper centrifuge that spins at up to 20 000 rpm,
				and can isolate malaria parasites from blood in 15 minutes.
				This paper centrifuge costs 20 cents, and works without electricity. 
				Normal centrifuges are massive, and costs several hundreds, possibly thousands of dollars.</p>

		 <p class = "photo">The foldscope is a paper microscope that has a magnification of
		140x and 2-micron resolution. With this microscope, you can see things lice bacteria, blood cells, 
		single-celled organisms and even malaria parasites. And it only costs 50 cents to make! This 
		makes it easier to provide healthcare for developing countries. This can be distributed 
				quickly in the event of a pandemic etc. </p>

		<div class = "smallpic">  <img src = "IMAGES/Theranos.png" alt = "Blood processing unit"> 
		 <p class = "photo">Theranos created a device that was going to revolutionize blood testing. 
			By just taking a small drop of blood, the machine was going to be able to perform more blood tests 
				than a regular blood testing machine could. This device in particular turned out to be non-existant.
				But if it was real, it would have been a great example of frugal innovation. </p></div>

		 <p class = "photo">M-Pesa (M for mobile, pesa means money in Swahili) is a mobile phone based money 
		 transferring service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone Group plc and Safaricom, the largest mobile network in Kenya.
		 Since 80 % of the population in Africa does not have a bank account, but roughly 82% has a mobile phone, this service is greatly needed there. 
		 It can be compared to the app "Vipps" many norwegians use on a daily basis.
